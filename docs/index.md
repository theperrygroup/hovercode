## Hovercode Python SDK

This SDK is a typed Python client for the [Hovercode QR code API](https://hovercode.com/).
It supports creating static or dynamic QR codes and managing them programmatically.

### Important security note

Do **not** call the Hovercode API directly from a browser/front-end app. Your API token
must be kept private and should only be used from a trusted backend.

### Quickstart

```python
from hovercode import HovercodeClient

client = HovercodeClient()  # reads HOVERCODE_API_TOKEN

qr = client.hovercodes.create(
    workspace="YOUR-WORKSPACE-ID",
    qr_data="https://twitter.com/hovercodeHQ",
    primary_color="#1DA1F2",
)

print(qr["id"])
```

### What you can do

- **Create QR codes** (static or dynamic)
- **List QR codes** for a workspace (with optional search)
- **Get a single QR code** by ID
- **Update a QR code** (e.g., change destination for dynamic link codes)
- **Add tags** to QR codes
- **Get tracking activity** for dynamic codes
- **Delete QR codes**
- **Verify webhook signatures** (for scan webhooks)
