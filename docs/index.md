## Hovercode Python SDK

This SDK is a typed Python client for the [Hovercode QR code API](https://hovercode.com/).
It supports creating static or dynamic QR codes and managing them programmatically.

### Important security note

Do **not** call the Hovercode API directly from a browser/front-end app. Your API token
must be kept private and should only be used from a trusted backend.

### Static vs dynamic QR codes (quick explanation)

- **Static QR**: the destination (`qr_data`) is embedded directly in the code and **cannot be changed**
  after creation.
- **Dynamic QR**: the QR code points to a shortlink you control; you can **update the destination later**.

In the Hovercode API, QR codes are static by default. Set `dynamic=True` when creating to make them dynamic.

### Quickstart

```python
from hovercode import HovercodeClient

client = HovercodeClient()  # reads HOVERCODE_API_TOKEN

qr = client.hovercodes.create(
    workspace="YOUR-WORKSPACE-ID",
    qr_data="https://twitter.com/hovercodeHQ",
    primary_color="#1DA1F2",
)

print(qr["id"])
```

### What you need from Hovercode

- **API token**: used for the `Authorization: Token …` header
- **Workspace ID**: required by the create/list endpoints

You can find both in your Hovercode settings area while logged in.

### What you can do

- **Create QR codes** (static or dynamic)
- **List QR codes** for a workspace (with optional search)
- **Get a single QR code** by ID
- **Update a QR code** (e.g., change destination for dynamic link codes)
- **Add tags** to QR codes
- **Get tracking activity** for dynamic codes
- **Delete QR codes**
- **Verify webhook signatures** (for scan webhooks)

### Common response fields (glossary)

Hovercode responses may include fields like:

- `id`: QR code UUID
- `qr_data`: the destination/content
- `qr_type`: `"Link"` or `"Text"`
- `dynamic`: whether the code is dynamic
- `shortlink_url`: short URL (dynamic codes)
- `svg`: SVG string (can be embedded or written to a `.svg` file)
- `svg_file` / `png`: hosted file URLs (may appear on create if `generate_png=True`, or later via get)
